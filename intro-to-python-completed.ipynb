It's extremely popular, and is used in a variety of disciplines: data science and machine learning, scripting, web development, scientific computing, game development, you name it! And, above all, it's relatively English-like and easy to learn :)\n",

        "2. booleans and conditionals\n",
        "3. using and writing functions\n",
        "4. lists and loops\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of the workshop, you'll be equipped with programming skills that are common in **every major programming language**. In other words, they're transferrable to almost any type of programming - which you'll probably be doing!\n",
        "\n",
