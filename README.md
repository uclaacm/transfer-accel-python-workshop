# intro to python and appplications (@ transfer accelerator '21)

Hi there! These are the Jupyter notebooks/Google Colabs for the "intro to python and applications" workshop that we ([Matt](https://matthewwang.me), he/him and [John](https://www.johndang.me/), he/him) ran at UCLA Engineering's Transfer Accelerator '21. The focus of this workshop is to teach programming fundamentals in the Python programming language, and then to run through a quick, real-world application of Python (linear regression with numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn). We assume no prior programming experience, though any is always helpful.

As a note: this is technically "one workshop", but it's split up into two notebooks, `intro-to-python.ipynb` and `data-science-applications.ipynb`. We recommend doing the intro notebook first, and then the data science applications notebook. More information about the workshop, including learning goals, understanding checks, and exercises, are all in the notebooks!

(we also include the results of the notebook after the live demo - this is `intro-to-python-completed.ipynb`)

The Engineering Transfer center [graciously recorded this workshop on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoKkqdzEeJ0)!

## Using These Notebooks

We ran these workshops on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/), a platform that allows any user with a Google account to run, store, and share their Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud! If you don't have prior experience with notebooks, we *strongly recommend* using Colab.

To use these notebooks with Google Colab, simply upload the `.ipynb` files to your Google Drive; then, open them with Google Colab (either double-clicking, or "Open With > Google Colab").

Alternatively, these can be run with the core [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) software; either via uploading to [their "Try Classic Notebook" service on IPython](https://jupyter.org/try), or using [JuptyerLab](https://jupyter.org/try) online or locally.
